# Car Damage Classification with Custom CNN and ResNet50
The files necessary to completely run the notebook:
**Download the file necessary to run the CNN Model with the following link:**
üîó **[Download Final Dataset Used For CNN Model (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1898L8prHBT9T8uW8jEIEEqsCF0PQhd6T/view?usp=drive_link)**. 
Download the file necessary for checking data preprocessing , its for transparency you may even not consider to reproduce it,**1st file used:**
**[Download initial Dataset I constructed (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoaTT2RAeIpiiaOwghFmpRi6lbtu-P-Y/view?usp=drive_link)**. 
**2nd file used in preprocessing:**
**[Download Train Set Which is Going to be shown how it was augmented (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MJy9WBvSyDxwd0j72zPs9Mhqi3lBcjrv/view?usp=drive_link)**. 
**Important note!** To easily run the ipynb file as it was initially created in Google Colab Free version you'd need to upload the files I provided with the links above on drive which is connected to your Google Colab account (If you decide to test it there). **Files should not be uploaded as a folder, they should directly be placed/uploaded in "My Drive" as zip files as they are to make sure the paths defined in the codes work properly!** So, there should be 3 separate zip files on your drive uploaded with no modifications. If you are not interested in data preprocessing transparency part, you can use only the final dataset I used in the 1st link above which runs the models. 

So, ipynb file in the 1st part shows how generally Initial dataset was cleaned (its no necessary to run for Model, it has demonstration purposes for transparency). 2nd part is the actual Model(s) and Analysis.

## üìå Project Overview 
This deep learning capstone project classifies images from a **cleaned 6 class car damage classification dataset** using:
- A custom CNN model built from scratch
- A fine-tuned ResNet50 transfer learning model
- Data construction details:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshu2198/ripik-hackfest 
From that 1st dataset link I picked 4 major classes: Dent,scratches , Tire_Flat,Glass_Shatter, Lamp broken. Note I unified dents and scratches into "Surface_Damage(Dents, Scratches)" class.
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwalbhamere/car-damage-severity-dataset
From this 2nd dataset link I picked Severe damage class and used as "significant_damage" in my dataset.
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samwash94/comprehensive-car-damage-detection
From that 3rd dataset link I picked "R_Normal: Rear view of undamaged cars" , "F_Normal: Front view of undamaged cars" and unified them as "No_Damage" class in my dataset. 

It includes thorough preprocessing, robust evaluation (including confidence intervals), and external image testing.

## üß† Key Features
- Cleaning via perceptual image hashing (`ImageHash`)
- Offline manual dataset splitting into Train/Validation/Test sets
- Augmentation applied only to training set for generalization
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, per-class accuracy, bootstrap and binomial confidence intervals
- External (out-of-sample) image tested on both models
- Comparison between scratch CNN and ResNet50

## üìä My Final Results
| Model        | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Custom CNN   | 86.5%                | 84.7%          |
| ResNet50     | 93.9%                | 94.1%          |
